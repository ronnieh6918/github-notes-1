* What is a Git?
  * "Git" is the version control software (the application)
* What is a Github?
  * "Github" is different from a git because it is the web service that enables people to do "Git" on a website by signing up for it. However, a similarity is that both git and github allow you to view the version history.
* What is a Repo?
  * A "repo" is another word for "project", allowing multiple files to be within it (a repository of files)
* What is a Commit?
  * "Commit" works as a "save" button and confirms that you want to commit to your changes to the file. Commits have a "hash", which is a code made up of numbers and letters. You can also add notes to your commits so you remember what you did for each edit.
